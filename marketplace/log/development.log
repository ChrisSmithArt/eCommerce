ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs AdminUser attributes explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `AdminUser`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class AdminUser < ApplicationRecord

  # ...

  def self.ransackable_attributes(auth_object = nil)
    ["created_at", "email", "encrypted_password", "id", "id_value", "remember_created_at", "reset_password_sent_at", "reset_password_token", "updated_at"]

model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs TaxRateByLocation attributes explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `TaxRateByLocation`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs User attributes explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `User`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord

  # ...

  def self.ransackable_attributes(auth_object = nil)
    ["address", "created_at", "description", "email", "id", "id_value", "password", "tax_rate_by_location_id", "updated_at", "user_name"]

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs User associations explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `User`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

  def self.ransackable_associations(auth_object = nil)

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs Like attributes explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `Like`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class Like < ApplicationRecord

  def self.ransackable_attributes(auth_object = nil)
    ["created_at", "id", "id_value", "order_item_id", "updated_at", "user_id"]

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs Like attributes explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `Like`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class Like < ApplicationRecord

  # ...

  def self.ransackable_attributes(auth_object = nil)
    ["created_at", "id", "id_value", "order_item_id", "updated_at", "user_id"]

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs OrderDetail attributes explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `OrderDetail`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs OrderItemStatus associations explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `OrderItemStatus`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class OrderItemStatus < ApplicationRecord

  # ...

  def self.ransackable_associations(auth_object = nil)
    ["order_items"]

ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs OrderItemStatus attributes explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `OrderItemStatus`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class OrderItemStatus < ApplicationRecord

  # ...

  def self.ransackable_attributes(auth_object = nil)
    ["created_at", "id", "id_value", "status", "updated_at"]
